************************************Day 2*********************************

Restrictions 
1.Observations
2.Variables


Restrictions over observations can be used only with SET statement in DATA Step

Homework - How SET statement can be used in PROC Step


Restrictions over variables i.e keep and Drop can be used with SET statement, DATA statement as an option. It can also be used as statement itself.

Homework Use Keep and Drop in PROC step

SORT 

PROC FREQ produces one way frequency tables or contingency tables

To generate cross tablation we use * between variables

IMPORT/EXPORT


EXPORT - Export SAS dataset into EXCEL,CSV and Text


Xls ---Xls else use (tab)
CSV ----CSV
txt----tab else use (dlm)


IMPORT  --

 
Day 4*******************

PROC MEANS - Freq Mean StdDev, Min, Max

PROC SUMMARY - No of observations

PROC SUMMARY need a PRINT keyword or Output OUt Statement. You need to specify the variables as well as the 
statistic you want to calculate

PROC TABULATE -- VAR and TABLES Statement

PROC UNIVARIATE which gives a all sort of statistics

Using UNiVARIATE we can make Histogram

PPPlot & QQPLot

SAS Functions -- SAS functions are used for Data Manipulation. SAS functions are used only in DATA STEP

1. DATE 2.Character/Text 3. Numeric


SCAN function is used to break the string on the basis delimiter



Numeric Functions:


Input is the function used to change charcater type variable to Numeric variable.
Put is the function used to change Numeric to character variable.
